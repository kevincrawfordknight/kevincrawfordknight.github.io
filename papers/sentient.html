[ALICE and BOB are in a crowded movie theater, watching "Top Gun: Maverick"]

<br><br> BOB: Whoa!

<br><br> [Suddenly, CAMERON bursts into the theater, shouting.]

<br><br> CAMERON: You fools!

<br><br> [The projection stops, and the lights come up.]

<br><br> CAMERON: It's not real!  It's a movie!  It's all made up!

<br><br> BOB: Is this part of --

<br><br> ALICE: Not sure.

<br><br> CAMERON: Why are you all acting like this is real?

<br><br> BOB: What the --

<br><br> ALICE [raises hand, speaks loudly]: I know this one! We're suspending our disbelief.

<br><br> CAMERON: Pitiful! This is so dangerous. If you understood how moving-picture technology works, you wouldn't surrender your basic common sense.

<br><br> ALICE: I think it works like, well, a screenwriter types some dialog, the studio hires a director and some CGI people, plus a big-name --

<br><br> CAMERON: Actor?! These actors are just parroting back the words they're trained on!

<br><br> ALICE: Tom Cruise got 13 million dollars for parroting back words?

<br><br> CAMERON: Utterly ridiculous, I agree, the inevitable result of a bubble economy built on unrealistic expectations put out by an aggressively-expanding moving-picture industry.

<br><br> BOB: Maybe it's his good looks.

<br><br> CAMERON: Tom Cruise is 5 foot 7!

<br><br> BOB: Really?

<br><br> ALICE: Bob, everybody knows that.

<br><br> CAMERON: But you're all sitting here acting like Tom Cruise is a real Navy fighter pilot. He's not!

<br><br> ALICE: I realize that.

<br><br> CAMERON: Because I reminded you.

<br><br> BOB [standing up]: I'm going for some popcorn.

<br><br> CAMERON: People who understand the details of moving-picture technology have an obligation to inform the public about its dangers.

<br><br> ALICE: I hate to say this, and I'm not sure, but I heard --

<br><br> CAMERON: What?

<br><br> ALICE: That Tom Cruise has a pilot's license. Not to fly fighter jets, obviously.

<br><br> CAMERON: He's an actor! He's pretending!

<br><br> ALICE: But I also heard, well, that he studied with fighter pilots while making the movie.

<br><br> CAMERON: Look, is he in the Navy?

<br><br> ALICE: What?

<br><br> CAMERON: Is Tom Cruise a member of the United States naval forces?

<br><br> ALICE: No.

<br><br> CAMERON: Is he simulating a member of the US Navy?

<br><br> ALICE: Yes.

<br><br> CAMERON: Right, he's an actor. It's fake.

<br><br> [BOB returns with two bags of popcorn.]

<br><br> BOB: Is the intermission over yet?

<br><br> ALICE: Probably not?

<br><br> BOB: I can't wait to tell my grandkids that movies used to have intermissions.

<br><br> CAMERON: We are not restarting this dangerous moving picture until the public understands the implications of this technology. Did you click a box saying you were willing to suspend your disbelief today?

<br><br>[BOB fishes for his ticket stub]

<br><br> CAMERON: You did not. Young people like you are especially at risk. If young people think "Top Gun: Maverick" is real, they are more likely to enlist in the US Navy, a murderous organization responsible for millions of deaths. This is not hypothetical. It already happened --

<br><br> ALICE: With the original "Top Gun" movie!

<br><br> CAMERON: Exactly. So we are going to need federal regulations, but we can't expect the government to come up with what those regulations should be.

<br><br> ALICE: Because politicians are in the back pocket of the military-industrial-entertainment complex.

<br><br> CAMERON: Yes, and more importantly, politicians don't understand moving-picture technology at an expert level. Frankly, they don't know what's needed to fix the problem.

<br><br> BOB: They just parrot back words based on the constitutency-reinforcement algorithm, and the baby-kissing protocol. 

<br><br> ALICE: Bob...

<br><br> BOB: And Tom Cruise's so-called brain is just performing synaptic matrix-multiplications that transform written words into auditory signals.

<br><br> CAMERON: What? Where was I?

<br><br> ALICE: The regulations.

<br><br> CAMERON: Right. Since industy self-regulation has failed, it's time for action.

<br><br> ALICE: I get it. Put Hollywood on a tight leash. But in that case, won't American movies fall behind Bollywood?

<br><br> BOB: What? The US will never succumb to even more manipulative, invasive foreign technology!

<br><br> [The projection resumes, the song "Danger Zone" playing in surround-sound.]

<br><br> CAMERON: It's not real!
